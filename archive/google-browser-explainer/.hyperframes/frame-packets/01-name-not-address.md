## Frame 1 — A name is not an address

- scene: A minimal browser address bar receives `google.com`; the letters become a glowing destination pin with a question mark.
- duration: 6.4s
- transition_in: cut
- status: built
- voiceover: "You type google.com, press Enter, and your browser begins a tiny trip across the internet."

- type: hook
- persuasion: Imagine scenario + curiosity gap
- beat: Curiosity

narrativeRole: Opens on the familiar action and makes the hidden journey feel worth seeing.
keyMessage: A web address starts a process; it is not itself the destination a network can route to.

blueprint: compose
focal: `google.com` address-bar wordmark
roles: address bar = foreground subject; orange field = background; destination-pin question mark = supporting
sfx: none

Scene 1 (0.0–2.1s): `google.com` types into a left-anchored browser bar via type-on with caret (`discrete-text-sequence`); orange cover, asymmetric 60/40.
Scene 2 (2.1–4.7s): as “tiny trip” lands, the letters cluster then expand into a route-pin and first network line via cluster→outward expansion (`center-outward-expansion`); layered-depth.
Scene 3 (4.7–6.4s): the address and pin settle; hold the read, no ambient drift.

## Selected blueprint: typewriter-reveal

# typewriter-reveal — Typewriter Reveal

**intent**: A live text caret types (and edits) a line as a human would, then either collapses it to a point and pops a brand payoff, or holds it under a persistent brand mark while a sub-line types/swaps into the final CTA — making "someone is typing this" the engine of the shot.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-typed-line-to-reveal): Type a relatable question/statement live, then COLLAPSE it and spring-pop the brand — a logo lockup OR a product-UI moment ("here's the everyday pain, now here's us").
- Brand_Outro (from brand-outro-persistent-mark-cta-rail): Hold the hero mark dead-center/top the whole shot while a sub-line beneath it swaps or types its way into the final CTA — landing the ask once the logo is already established.

**duration**: 3.6–7s (Brand_Outro 3.6–6.0s · Hook 5.5–7s)

**shot structure** (one consolidated template; `[slots]` are product-agnostic)

- Scene 1 (0.0–~2.0s): On a solid `[bg color]` field, a blinking text-input caret `|` sits at the line start, then `[primary line]` TYPES on character-by-character with the caret trailing.
  - _Variant — Hook_: nothing else is on screen; the typed `[hook line]` owns the frame. (Sub-variant: the line types inside UI chrome — a rounded `[input/pill]` — and the whole assembly continuously TRANSLATES leftward + scales slightly so the active caret stays pinned near frame-center while earlier words scroll off and clip past the left edge — a ticker push.)
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a `[logo mark]` (+ optional `[wordmark]`) is already centered/upper and STAYS fully visible for the entire shot; an entry flourish plays on the mark itself (e.g. `[checkmark/icon]` strokes into the mark, or thin concentric rings ripple outward from it), and the typed `[tagline / product label]` is the SUB-LINE beneath the mark.

- Scene 2 (~2.0–4.5s): The typed line is MODIFIED in place — the active text is edited rather than re-shot.
  - _Variant — Hook_: final word(s) BACKSPACE out and a new word RETYPES (`[word A]` → `[word B]`), or the fill/caret snaps to `[accent color]` on the final word. Holds briefly.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: the sub-line is REMOVED in place — a direct hard CUT/replace (NO backspace) or a moving mask-WIPE erases it — while the mark performs a small idle move (gentle rotate / sparkle reposition); the mark never leaves frame.

- Scene 3 — resolve:
  - _Variant — Hook (collapse, ~0.3–0.7s)_: caret vanishes; the whole text/assembly COLLAPSES to a point at center (horizontal X-collapse or scale-to-0 zoom-out) and disappears, leaving a clean `[bg]`. Then (remainder) a centered `[brand element]` SPRING-POPS in:
    - _logo-lockup sub-variant_: a `[mark/icon]` pops, then slides aside as a `[wordmark]` UNMASKS / slides out from behind it; both settle into a centered lockup.
    - _product-UI sub-variant_: a `[UI control]` (e.g. button) pops; a `[cursor]` sweeps in from a corner and homes onto it; on contact a ~150ms state-FLIP — base cross-fades to `[accent color]`, icon inverts, and a soft radial GLOW blooms outward and persists.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (~4.5s–end)_: the final `[CTA]` resolves in the sub-line slot — TYPED in with a caret and/or shown as a `[CTA in accent-color button]` beside plain text; an optional `[accent color]` GLOW ring / halo settles around the persistent mark. Holds to end. Final frame: `[logo mark]` + (glow ring) + `[CTA]`.

**motion vocabulary**: blinking text caret; character-by-character type-on; backspace-and-retype OR in-place hard-cut/mask-wipe text swap; optional leftward ticker push (assembly translates to keep caret centered); persistent centered hero mark (never vanishes) with entry flourish (icon stroke-draw, concentric ripple rings) and small idle move (rotate / sparkle); X-collapse / scale-to-0 zoom-out of the typed line; spring-pop brand reveal; wordmark unmask-slide into lockup; cursor sweep + UI state-flip + radial glow bloom; accent glow/halo ring settle; pill/button CTA reveal; hold.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- blinking text caret → `context-sensitive-cursor` (caret color-switch + blink)
- character-by-character type-on → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing/typos/holds/backspace); recipe `gsap-effects` (typewriter)
- backspace-and-retype → `discrete-text-sequence`
- in-place hard-cut / replace text swap → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-text state swaps)
- mask-wipe erase of sub-line → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (run in reverse)
- leftward ticker push (assembly translates to keep caret centered) → `camera-cursor-tracking` (viewport follows a moving caret)
- persistent hero mark hold → no motion rule needed (static anchor; intentional — it's the absence of motion)
- entry flourish: icon stroke-draw into mark → `svg-path-draw`
- entry flourish: concentric ripple rings from mark → `cursor-click-ripple` (ripple bloom)
- small idle mark move (rotate / sparkle reposition) → `sine-wave-loop` (idle)
- X-collapse / scale-to-0 zoom-out of typed line → `scale-swap-transition` (closest fit — it morphs/collapses elements at a shared center; approximation, since a standalone collapse-and-vanish without the paired same-center brand pop isn't its exact case)
- spring-pop brand reveal → `spring-pop-entrance` (alt `physics-press-reaction`)
- collapse-text → pop-brand as a same-center morph pair → `scale-swap-transition` (morph two elements at same center)
- wordmark unmask-slide into lockup → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (unmask); slide via `spring-pop-entrance`
- cursor sweep onto UI control + press → `cursor-click-ripple` (cursor→target press + ripple)
- UI state-flip (base/icon invert on contact) → `hacker-flip-3d`
- radial glow bloom / accent glow-halo ring settle → `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow); ring expansion via `center-outward-expansion`
- pill/button CTA reveal → `spring-pop-entrance` (alt `scale-swap-transition`)

**camera modifier**: none required — camera is static for both roles. The Hook ticker push is an ELEMENT translate (the typed assembly slides leftward to keep the caret centered), not a camera move → modeled by `camera-cursor-tracking` rather than a true camera rule.

## Selected motion rule: center-outward-expansion

description: Elements start clustered at screen center and expand outward to their final positions, driven by a shared progress value.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

## Values

| token          | range                | notes                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH | ≥ widest state                               | measure with a hidden probe after `document.fonts.ready` if unsure     |
| milestone `t`s      | keystrokes 0.06–0.20s apart; pauses 0.3–0.6s | monotonically increasing; `T_DONE ≤ TOTAL_DURATION − ~1s` climax dwell |
| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
