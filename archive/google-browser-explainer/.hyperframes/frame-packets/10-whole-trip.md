## Frame 10 — The whole trip

- scene: The full sequence condenses into one illuminated route: name → DNS → IP → secure connection → request → resources → rendered page.
- duration: 7.4s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: built
- voiceover: "So one address becomes a lookup, a secure conversation, a request, a response, and the page in front of you."
- src: compositions/frames/10-whole-trip.html
- type: branding
- persuasion: Distillation + callback
- beat: Now I get it
- blueprint: titlecard-reveal

narrativeRole: Compresses the process into a memorable mental model.
keyMessage: Typing a URL triggers a fast, coordinated sequence that ends in a rendered webpage.

blueprint: compose
focal: name-to-page summary route
roles: route labels = foreground sequence; final page = foreground payoff; orange field = background
sfx: none

Scene 1 (0.0–3.5s): name, DNS, and secure appear sequentially along the route via per-word staggered reveal (`dynamic-content-sequencing`); full-width strip.
Scene 2 (3.5–6.2s): request and render snap on via kinetic beat-slam (`kinetic-beat-slam`) as the summary names them.
Scene 3 (6.2–7.4s): route resolves to `page`; hold the final takeaway.

## Selected blueprint: titlecard-reveal

# titlecard-reveal — Title-Card / Single-Card Reveal

**intent**: The calm breather/landing beat — one clean title or single brand/proof card revealed with exactly one restrained move (a slide-up crossfade, or a wipe-away-to-reveal), then a still hold. Low motion is the payload, not a deficiency.

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `benefits-titlecard-crossfade`, #34): a calm two-line value title card — headline value line, then one slide-up crossfade to a qualifier/elaboration line that holds center.
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-reveal-card`, #35): wipe a busy app-collage open away with one diagonal pill-sweep to reveal a clean brand lockup (icon + wordmark) plus a centered "loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" social-proof line that spring-settles and holds.
- CTA (from `hard-cut-card-stack-to-logo`): a monochrome end-card
  CHAIN — statement → CTA / availability line → brand wordmark/logo — separated by instant hard
  cuts at full opacity; each card is its own allocated stillness, and the sequence terminates on
  the logo held to the final frame.
- Product_Intro (from `title-card-prelude-chain`): a three-beat dark title
  PRELUDE before any product UI — `[logo]` pop → `[name]` (a `[version]` appends grey→bright) →
  `[tagline]` card — chained by clears and blur-snap handoffs rather than hard cuts.

**duration**: 3–5s (Benefits 3–4s; Social_Proof ~5s / observed 4.7s). Card chains run 2–3s per
card, ~5.5–9.5s total.

**shot structure**

```
Scene 1 (0.0–~0.4s): static camera on [neutral / dark background]. Establish the opening state.
  Variant — Benefits: empty-to-text — [benefit line 1] is about to fade in centered (no busy open).
  Variant — Social_Proof: a busy intro frame holds briefly — an [app-screenshot / use-case collage] of overlapping cards under a [setup line].

Scene 2 (~0.4–~1.5s): the ONE move executes — a single restrained reveal that brings the calm card to center.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] fades in centered while scaling slightly (~95%→100%, smooth ease-out) and holds.
  Variant — Social_Proof: a large [accent-color] rounded pill sweeps diagonally bottom-left → top-right and exits the corner, clip-path wiping the collage away to reveal the [brand logo lockup] beneath as the [logo icon] strokes draw on.

Scene 3 (~1.5s–end): the revealed/settled card holds to the end (the allocated stillness). At most one subtle live element (a slow breathing pulse on the card, or a very slow camera drift). No second development phase.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] translates up and fades out as [benefit line 2 — qualifier / elaboration] translates up from below center and fades in to take center; holds. (This single slide-up crossfade IS the one move — Benefits front-loads no Scene-2 wipe.)
  Variant — Social_Proof: the lockup — [logo icon] centered, [wordmark] below, centered [social-proof tagline] "Loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" (the [N]+ may count up) — spring-settles small, then holds.

Variant — card chain (CTA end-card stack / Product_Intro title prelude): the single-card contract
repeats 2–3 times in sequence. Each card is a complete Scene 1–3 in miniature — arrive (or simply
BE there), at most one restrained move, hold — and the seams between cards are INSTANT hard cuts
at full opacity (no crossfade, no fade-through-black) or, in the prelude flavor, a blur-away →
snap-into-focus handoff.
  Card moves stay on budget: a character-by-character type-on with visible partial states, a
  right-to-left backspace that resolves the [wordmark] into the small [logo icon], a grey→bright
  append ("[name]" gains "[version]"), a blur-snap into focus — or nothing beyond a
  barely-perceptible continuous slow scale-up across the hold.
  The final card is always the [brand logo / lockup], held static to the last frame.
```

**motion vocabulary**: single restrained reveal (gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle | diagonal clip-path pill-wipe), one slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits), icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof), optional "[N]+ teams" count-up, logo+tagline spring-settle-and-hold, subtle breathing on the held card, hold-to-end. Calm register — no spring chains, no tumble, no per-beat flips, no second phase. Camera static (optional very slow drift only). Card-chain register: instant hard cut at full opacity as the only seam, barely-perceptible
continuous slow scale-up across each hold, character-by-character type-on with visible partial
states, right-to-left backspace collapsing the wordmark into the logo icon, grey→bright text
append, blur-away → snap-into-focus card handoff, logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude opener),
monochrome text-on-solid throughout.

**rule mapping**

- gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle (Benefits Scene 2) → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (restrained in/settle; cross-reference the fade ease in `techniques.md`)
- single slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits Scene 3) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md` (one line hands off to the next; translate-up + crossfade)
- diagonal pill-wipe reveal (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `../techniques.md` (clip-path reveal masks — the wipe)
- icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/svg-path-draw.md`
- "[N]+ teams" count-up (Social_Proof Scene 3, optional) → `rules/counting-dynamic-scale.md`
- logo + tagline spring-settle-and-hold (Social_Proof Scene 3) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` (single soft settle; intentionally one beat, not a chain)
- subtle breathing on the held card (the one live element during the hold) → `rules/sine-wave-loop.md`
- type-on / backspace / grey→bright append (chain cards) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md`
  (non-linear typing incl. backspace; drive the version append as a bulk addition)
- wordmark remainder resolves into the logo icon → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (same-center
  swap fired as the last character deletes)
- barely-perceptible slow scale-up across a hold → the camera-modifier drift
  (`rules/multi-phase-camera.md`, micro-drift register) applied per-card
- blur-away → snap-into-focus handoff (prelude flavor) → `rules/depth-of-field-blur.md` (single
  pull on the outgoing / incoming card)
- logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude card 1) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` +
  `rules/ambient-glow-bloom.md`
- instant hard cut at full opacity → not a rule: a timeline `tl.set` swap — deliberately NO
  transition entry.

**camera modifier**: optional — a single very slow drift/push under the hold only → `rules/multi-phase-camera.md`. Default is fully static; do not add unless the held beat would otherwise read as a freeze-frame.

**stillness note**: This is a legitimate allocated-stillness beat. The hold in Scene 3 is the deliverable, not an unanimated gap — do NOT manufacture a development phase, extra swaps, or force-animation. One restrained move + a subtle hold (optionally one breathing element or one slow drift) is the correct and complete shape. The card-chain variant does not break this: each card individually obeys the one-move + hold
contract, and the hard cut is a seam, not a move. Boundary: if the cards flip at sub-second tempo
or each beat carries its own entrance/exit energy, you have left this blueprint — that is
`kinetic-type-beats` (its CTA variant owns the high-tempo value-line stack).

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Kinetic Beat Slam

Short phrases hit one at a time on a **steady beat**, each with a _different_ entrance, then stack into a locked finale — the recipe for "punchy / rhythmic" text-forward pieces (taglines, manifestos, hype intros). The difference between generic and rhythmic is (1) one shared **onset array** driving every element, (2) **distinct** entrances per phrase rather than one reused helper, and (3) optional **rhythm chrome** that visibly keeps the beat.

## How It Works

A single tempo grid — `PULSE` seconds per sub-beat, `BEATS = [t0, t1, t2, …]` on that grid — is the rhythmic spine; every phrase entrance, accent, and chrome tick reads its time from it, so the piece locks to one pulse instead of drifting hand-tuned offsets. Each phrase gets a different transform axis (scale+blur slam / side snap / rise+rotate) with short attacks (0.35–0.6s on the hit), then the stack holds with a finite low-amplitude breath.

## Variations

- **Entrance easing by attack character** — `power4.out` hard slam ⭐ default hit · `expo.out` hardest snap (side-snaps, whip-ins) · `back.out(2)` overshoot pop (accents only, not body words) · `circ.out` heavy rise with momentum. Use **at least 3 distinct easings** across the piece.
- **Rhythm chrome alternatives** — a center beat bar or a `// label` monospace tag pulsing on-beat instead of the 5-tick metronome; mark any decorative that must survive a shader transition per `../transitions/overview.md`.
- **Finale dressing** — stack + accent underline sweep ([css-marker-patterns](css-marker-patterns.md)); don't just leave the last phrase sitting.

| display face      | 150px+, heavy weight | Archivo Black / League Gothic / Oswald — see `hyperframes-creative/references/typography.md` |

## Critical Constraints

- **One beat array, not scattered offsets** — every element times off `BEATS[]` / `PULSE`; this is the single biggest lever for "rhythmic".
- **Different entrance per phrase** — a reused `punchIn()` for all lines is the flat-but-competent tell. Vary the motion axis, reuse the ease _family_.
- **Finale repeat math**: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)` — `Math.ceil` overshoots `data-duration` and trips the `gsap_repeat_ceil_overshoot` lint rule; a negative repeat is read by GSAP as `-1` (infinite).
- **No banned exit animations between scenes** — in a montage the _transition_ is the exit (`../transitions/overview.md`); only a final scene may fade out.
- **Display font must be embedded** or it silently falls back at render — Anton / Bebas-as-literal are NOT embedded (`Bebas Neue` aliases to League Gothic; verify in `typography.md`).
