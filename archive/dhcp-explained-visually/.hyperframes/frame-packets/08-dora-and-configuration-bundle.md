## Frame 8 — DORA and the configuration bundle

- scene: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge stack into a large D-O-R-A mnemonic beside five compact configuration badges.
- duration: 11.586668014526367s
- poster: 6s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/08-dora-and-configuration-bundle.html
- voiceover: "Remember DORA: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge. DHCP often delivers the whole starter bundle: IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, and lease time."
- type: social_proof
- persuasion: Coined term / mnemonic + numbered enumeration
- beat: Mastery
- blueprint: constellation-hub

narrativeRole: Compress the four-step exchange into a memorable sequence and widen the viewer’s definition of what DHCP provides.
keyMessage: DORA is the mnemonic, and DHCP commonly provides more than an IP address.
focal: four-step DORA icon sequence and configuration bundle
roles: Discover/Offer/Request/Acknowledge icons = foreground sequence; D-O-R-A letters = supporting mnemonic; bundle card = right foreground subject; dark field = background
sfx: none

Scene 1 (0.0–2.8s): four modest icons reveal beside their D-O-R-A labels in a vertical stack via staggered icon reveal (`waterfall-entry`); asymmetric 40/60.
Scene 2 (2.8–6.7s): a single route line links the four steps in order; icons remain separated with no overlap.
Scene 3 (6.7–11.59s): IP, mask, gateway, DNS, and lease chips appear inside the right bundle card via layer-reveal; held read.

## Selected blueprint: constellation-hub

# constellation-hub — Constellation / Hub + Satellites

**intent**: Labeled/iconned nodes spring into a ring/cluster around a center, then the shot resolves on the core — either by pushing the camera INTO the center (depth-of-field collapsing onto it) or by holding a hub mark while the satellites ORBIT it; the "everything connects to / sits around one center" beat.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-cluster-push-in`): a constellation of tool/app nodes springs into a wide ring, then a sustained camera push-in with depth-of-field resolves on the inner core — "it connects everything / one hub for all your tools."
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-orbit-ecosystem`): the product brand mark lands as the center hub and partner logos spring onto a ring and revolve around it — "plugs into / sits at the center of your stack."
- CTA (from `cta-orbit-collapse`): the ring resolves by COLLAPSE rather than a push-in — category icons drift around an empty central CTA, a cursor click implodes the orbit toward the click point, and the product demo springs OUT of that collapse as the answer (scope → choice → consequence → product).
- Social_Proof (from `proof-logo-chain`): a persistent center logo accrues proofs — its wordmark decodes, a claim ticker swaps, the logo glides to center, then avatars cascade into orbit with drawn connectors while partner logos scroll the bottom strip; four claims read as one statement.
- Social_Proof (from `scatter-drift-finisher`): the ecosystem beat as a
  static END CARD — a two-line serif `[headline]` is the center (no hub mark, no ring), `[~20 app
icons]` pop in scattered frame-wide in a quick stagger, then keep drifting very slowly OUTWARD
  to the end. "Connects to thousands of apps" said with count and spread, not geometry.

**duration**: 5–8s (Hook 5–6s · Social_Proof 5–8s · CTA orbit-collapse ~6s · Social_Proof
scatter-drift end card ~2.5s as a closing beat)

**shot structure**

Consolidated template — nodes ring a center, then one of two finishers resolves on the core.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s): `[bg]` (dark/space field, optionally slow-drifting diffused gradient blobs). `[primary nodes]` (circles carrying `[icon]` + label) SPRING-POP in (scale 0→1, ~1.15 elastic overshoot, staggered) arranged in a wide ring/cluster around an empty or marked center `[hub]`.
- Scene 2 (~0.7–2.5s, overlapping): smaller `[secondary nodes]` (platform / partner-logo chips) pop in staggered with the same elastic spring, filling the gaps; optional thin `[accent]` connector lines / orbit ring draw from hub→nodes. Camera holds.
- Scene 3 (~2.5–Xs, the resolve): see finisher variant below; lands and HOLDS on the magnified / orbited center to the end.

- Variant — Hook (push-in finisher): from Scene 3, a continuous smooth CAMERA PUSH-IN toward the center inner cluster — inner nodes scale up and stay sharp while outer nodes are pushed toward the edges and progressively BLUR (depth-of-field), background scales up smoothly; holds magnified on the core.
- Variant — Social_Proof (orbit finisher): the center `[brand mark]` snaps in via a quick 3D rotate that decelerates and settles; a thin `[accent]` orbit ring draws around it; `[N partner badges]` spring onto the ring (staggered overshoot) and revolve CLOCKWISE while staying upright, under a continuous slow camera ZOOM-OUT (ecosystem reveal).
- Variant — Social_Proof (optional type-push-through opener, prepended before Scene 1): centered `[headline]` types/slides in with a huge transparent-fill OUTLINE copy of the same words behind it; the outline text scales up exponentially toward camera (high-speed dolly / push-through), breaches the frame, then HARD-CUTS to the hub bg of Scene 1.
- Variant — Social_Proof (scatter-drift finisher, no ring): the center is a two-line serif
  `[headline]` building in place (not a mark); `[~20 app icons]` pop in SCATTERED across the whole
  frame in a quick stagger — no ring geometry, no connectors — then sustain a very slow outward
  drift to the end. Camera fully static: no push-in, no zoom-out; the "everything around one
  center" reads from the drift vectors pointing away from the headline. Often chained as the end
  card of a preceding UI beat (the prior card dissolves into it).

**motion vocabulary**: staggered elastic spring-pop node entrances (~1.15 overshoot); slow gradient-blob drift; connector-line / orbit-ring draw-on; 3D snap-rotate-settle on the hub mark; continuous camera push-in (inner sharp, outer depth-of-field blur, bg scale-up); clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges; continuous slow camera zoom-out (ecosystem reveal); optional outline-text push-through dolly entry. Scatter-drift finisher: frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (staggered, no ring); sustained slow
outward icon drift; in-place two-line serif headline build; static-frame hold to the end.

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- staggered spring-pop node entrances → `spring-pop-entrance` (elastic overshoot) + `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); 3D-flip-in flavor → `orbit-3d-entry`
- ring / cluster layout of nodes around a center → `avatar-cloud-network` (nodes on an elliptical ring + SVG lines to a center)
- icons on the nodes → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- connector lines hub→node → `svg-path-draw`
- orbit-ring draw-on → `svg-path-draw`
- slow gradient-blob drift → `sine-wave-loop` (idle looped drift)
- 3D snap-rotate-settle on hub mark → `orbit-3d-entry` (3D-flip entry); technique CSS-3D
- clockwise orbital revolve of upright badges → `orbit-3d-entry` (continuous elliptical orbit); technique MotionPath
- camera push-in toward center → `multi-phase-camera` (PUSH-in) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the core)
- background scale-up during push-in → `multi-phase-camera`
- continuous slow zoom-out (ecosystem reveal) → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) / `coordinate-target-zoom`
- outline-text push-through dolly opener (Social_Proof) → `3d-text-depth-layers` (outline copy behind) + `multi-phase-camera` (push-through)
- depth-of-field blur on outer nodes during push-in → `depth-of-field-blur` (progressive DOF/focus-falloff blur on the off-center outer nodes while the inner core stays sharp)
- frame-wide scattered icon pop-in (no ring) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group) +
  `gsap-effects` (stagger recipe); positions pre-baked scattered — NOT `avatar-cloud-network`'s
  elliptical ring
- sustained slow outward icon drift → `center-outward-expansion` (outward vectors, slow sustained
  register — drift targets sit slightly past the pop-in positions)
- in-place serif headline build → `gsap-effects` (staggered line/word reveal)

**camera modifier**: push-in-with-DOF (Hook) — `multi-phase-camera` PUSH-in targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` onto the core; the focus-falloff blur half of it is backed by `depth-of-field-blur`. Orbit finisher (Social_Proof) — slow continuous zoom-out via `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back) while satellites revolve. Scatter-drift finisher (Social_Proof end card) — none: the frame never moves; the outward drift
is element-level.

# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |
