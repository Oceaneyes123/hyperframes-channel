## Frame 4 — Discover

- scene: A new client emits a packet that expands as a broadcast across the LAN; the DHCP server is not targeted by address.
- duration: 9.225488662719727s
- poster: 5s
- transition_in: push-slide RIGHT
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/04-discover.html
- voiceover: "First: Discover. The new client broadcasts, “I am new here. Is there a DHCP server?” It does not yet know the server’s address."
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Demonstration + subtractive framing
- beat: Comprehension
- blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

narrativeRole: Correct the most important first-contact misconception by showing the broadcast reaching the local network.
keyMessage: DHCP Discover is a local broadcast because the client does not yet know where the server is.
focal: DHCP DISCOVER packet and broadcast ring
roles: new laptop = foreground sender; broadcast ring = foreground motion; server and router = supporting stations; packet label = short cue
sfx: none

Scene 1 (0.0–2.4s): the new laptop raises a small `DISCOVER` packet via label reveal (`discrete-text-sequence`); layered-depth.
Scene 2 (2.4–6.3s): the packet expands into a local broadcast ring (`center-outward-expansion`) and reaches the LAN stations; full-width strip.
Scene 3 (6.3–9.23s): the ring holds around the network while the server remains unaddressed; clean held read.

## Selected blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

# spatial-pan-stations — Spatial Pan / Stations

**intent**: Pre-place a sequence of labeled stations on one oversized canvas, then traverse it with a single virtual camera — repeated lateral/diagonal pans that center each station in turn and reveal a callout at every stop, landing held on a final station.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-pan-timeline): a horizontal timeline of evenly-spaced milestones, left-panned beat by beat, each marker getting a spring-popped callout, landing on the present moment ("evolution / milestone walk leading up to us").
- Problem (from problem-camera-pan-stations): a connected web of pain "stations" linked by hand-drawn leading lines, diagonally panned station to station, ending on a tangled scribble knot ("too many disconnected steps — it's a mess").
- Product_Intro (from concept-demo-decode-pan): a two-shot strip bridged by ONE lateral pan — shot 1 holds a static phrase whose accent word 3D-flap-DECODES (the concept lands), then the camera pans across the strip (with background parallax) into shot 2, where a cursor drives a live typing demo. Pairs this pan with `cursor-ui-demo`'s focal-locked tracked typing.

**duration**: 7–10s (union of Hook 8–10s, Problem ~7s, concept-demo ~7s)

**shot structure**
One oversized flat canvas on a solid `[bg color]`; all stations/markers pre-placed in world space; `[accent color]` text + simple line-icons; one virtual `.world` camera pans ease-in-out between stops. Each station holds ~1.0s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s): Camera opens on station 1 — `[label 1 / first step]` centered. A reveal lands on it (see variants). Camera then begins to PAN toward station 2, sliding station 1 out of frame.
- Scene 2 → Scene N-1 (~1.0s each): Camera PANS (ease-in-out) to center the next station; on arrival its `[label k]` (+ optional `[secondary label]`) is REVEALED with the role reveal. Repeat per station.
- Scene N (final, ~last beat): One last pan lands on the terminal station; the final `[callout / landing element]` reveals and HOLDS to the end. Camera goes static on the punchline.

- Variant — Hook: stations sit as evenly-spaced `[markers]` on a thin horizontal `[timeline]` (lower third); pans are LEFT-only along the single axis (timeline scrolls left). Each callout is a bordered `[callout box]` + downward triangle (offset drop-shadow) that SPRING-POPS up (scale 0→100%, bouncy overshoot, transform-origin at triangle tip) reading `[label k]`; a `[secondary label, e.g. year]` fades in and RISES above it. Some mid markers arrive as plain static text revealed by the pan alone (no box). Final scene lands on the `[present-day label]`, springs, holds.
- Variant — Problem: stations are scattered across a 2D web; pans are DIAGONAL, STEERED by `[accent color]` hand-drawn lines — each station has a rough write-on line/arrow that draws toward the next and the camera follows it (Scene 1 also draws a loop/circle around the headline's key word). Each station = a white `[line-icon]` above its `[label]`, revealed plainly by the pan (no spring box). Final scene: the accent line spirals into a dense chaotic SCRIBBLE KNOT centered on the field; camera holds static on the tangle (visual punchline).

**motion vocabulary**
repeated ease-in-out camera pans (horizontal-left for Hook, diagonal-steered for Problem) across one large static canvas; pre-placed stations sliding through frame via the pan; spring-overshoot callout pop with triangle-tip origin (Hook); rise-and-fade secondary label (Hook); plain labels/icons arriving via the pan alone; rough hand-drawn "write-on" leading lines/arrows + loop/circle key-word mark (Problem); terminal chaotic-scribble knot draw (Problem); static hold on the final station/punchline.

**rule mapping**

- camera pan / traverse across the canvas (primary) → `viewport-change` (single `.world` wrapper transform; PAN mode)
- sequencing the repeated pan beats into stops → `multi-phase-camera`
- centering each station as the pan target → `coordinate-target-zoom` (used as pan-to-target, no zoom)
- spring-overshoot callout pop, triangle-tip origin (Hook) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- rise-and-fade secondary label + plain per-station label/icon reveals via the pan → `discrete-text-sequence`
- hand-drawn leading lines / arrows / loop-circle key-word mark / terminal scribble knot (Problem) → `svg-path-draw`
- station line-icons (Problem) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- static hold on the final station / punchline → (no motion; sustained held frame, no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: The pan IS the camera. One `.world` virtual-camera transform in PAN mode — `viewport-change` — sequenced across stops by `multi-phase-camera`, each stop targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (pan-to-target). No depth push-in (that distinguishes this from the cluster-push-in / dataviz-pushthrough blueprints).

## Selected motion rule: center-outward-expansion

description: Elements start clustered at screen center and expand outward to their final positions, driven by a shared progress value.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

## Values

| token          | range                | notes                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.
metadata:
  tags: text, typing, discrete, threshold, non-linear, sequence
---

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

| TYPE_DUR (smooth)   | `chars × 0.06–0.12s`                         | fast → relaxed                                                         |
| BLINK_CYCLES        | one cycle per 0.5–0.8s                       | `TOTAL_DURATION / 0.8 ≤ BLINK_CYCLES ≤ TOTAL_DURATION / 0.5`           |
| CURSOR_WIDTH        | ~0.3× font size                              | gap to text single-digit px so the cursor feels attached               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
