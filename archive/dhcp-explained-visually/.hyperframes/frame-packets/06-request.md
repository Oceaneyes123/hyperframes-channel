## Frame 6 — Request

- scene: The client receives the proposed card, sends a single return packet labeled `DHCP REQUEST`, and unselected offer paths dim.
- duration: 9.691638946533203s
- poster: 5s
- transition_in: push-slide RIGHT
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/06-request.html
- voiceover: "Then: Request. The client says, “I want to use that offered address.” If other servers made offers, this also signals which one was chosen."
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Demonstration + causal chain
- beat: Momentum
- blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

narrativeRole: Show selection as the bridge between a proposal and a confirmed lease.
keyMessage: DHCP Request selects the offered configuration.
focal: selected offer and DHCP REQUEST packet
roles: client = left foreground; selected offer = highlighted foreground card; dim alternatives = supporting context; request packet = foreground motion
sfx: none

Scene 1 (0.0–2.4s): client receives the highlighted offer via layer-reveal (`scale-swap-transition`); split-screen.
Scene 2 (2.4–6.8s): one `REQUEST` packet flies back toward the server (`motion-blur-streak`) while alternate paths dim.
Scene 3 (6.8–9.69s): the selected card locks to the client with a short connector glow; held read.

## Selected blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

# spatial-pan-stations — Spatial Pan / Stations

**intent**: Pre-place a sequence of labeled stations on one oversized canvas, then traverse it with a single virtual camera — repeated lateral/diagonal pans that center each station in turn and reveal a callout at every stop, landing held on a final station.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-pan-timeline): a horizontal timeline of evenly-spaced milestones, left-panned beat by beat, each marker getting a spring-popped callout, landing on the present moment ("evolution / milestone walk leading up to us").
- Problem (from problem-camera-pan-stations): a connected web of pain "stations" linked by hand-drawn leading lines, diagonally panned station to station, ending on a tangled scribble knot ("too many disconnected steps — it's a mess").
- Product_Intro (from concept-demo-decode-pan): a two-shot strip bridged by ONE lateral pan — shot 1 holds a static phrase whose accent word 3D-flap-DECODES (the concept lands), then the camera pans across the strip (with background parallax) into shot 2, where a cursor drives a live typing demo. Pairs this pan with `cursor-ui-demo`'s focal-locked tracked typing.

**duration**: 7–10s (union of Hook 8–10s, Problem ~7s, concept-demo ~7s)

**shot structure**
One oversized flat canvas on a solid `[bg color]`; all stations/markers pre-placed in world space; `[accent color]` text + simple line-icons; one virtual `.world` camera pans ease-in-out between stops. Each station holds ~1.0s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s): Camera opens on station 1 — `[label 1 / first step]` centered. A reveal lands on it (see variants). Camera then begins to PAN toward station 2, sliding station 1 out of frame.
- Scene 2 → Scene N-1 (~1.0s each): Camera PANS (ease-in-out) to center the next station; on arrival its `[label k]` (+ optional `[secondary label]`) is REVEALED with the role reveal. Repeat per station.
- Scene N (final, ~last beat): One last pan lands on the terminal station; the final `[callout / landing element]` reveals and HOLDS to the end. Camera goes static on the punchline.

- Variant — Hook: stations sit as evenly-spaced `[markers]` on a thin horizontal `[timeline]` (lower third); pans are LEFT-only along the single axis (timeline scrolls left). Each callout is a bordered `[callout box]` + downward triangle (offset drop-shadow) that SPRING-POPS up (scale 0→100%, bouncy overshoot, transform-origin at triangle tip) reading `[label k]`; a `[secondary label, e.g. year]` fades in and RISES above it. Some mid markers arrive as plain static text revealed by the pan alone (no box). Final scene lands on the `[present-day label]`, springs, holds.
- Variant — Problem: stations are scattered across a 2D web; pans are DIAGONAL, STEERED by `[accent color]` hand-drawn lines — each station has a rough write-on line/arrow that draws toward the next and the camera follows it (Scene 1 also draws a loop/circle around the headline's key word). Each station = a white `[line-icon]` above its `[label]`, revealed plainly by the pan (no spring box). Final scene: the accent line spirals into a dense chaotic SCRIBBLE KNOT centered on the field; camera holds static on the tangle (visual punchline).

**motion vocabulary**
repeated ease-in-out camera pans (horizontal-left for Hook, diagonal-steered for Problem) across one large static canvas; pre-placed stations sliding through frame via the pan; spring-overshoot callout pop with triangle-tip origin (Hook); rise-and-fade secondary label (Hook); plain labels/icons arriving via the pan alone; rough hand-drawn "write-on" leading lines/arrows + loop/circle key-word mark (Problem); terminal chaotic-scribble knot draw (Problem); static hold on the final station/punchline.

**rule mapping**

- camera pan / traverse across the canvas (primary) → `viewport-change` (single `.world` wrapper transform; PAN mode)
- sequencing the repeated pan beats into stops → `multi-phase-camera`
- centering each station as the pan target → `coordinate-target-zoom` (used as pan-to-target, no zoom)
- spring-overshoot callout pop, triangle-tip origin (Hook) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- rise-and-fade secondary label + plain per-station label/icon reveals via the pan → `discrete-text-sequence`
- hand-drawn leading lines / arrows / loop-circle key-word mark / terminal scribble knot (Problem) → `svg-path-draw`
- station line-icons (Problem) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- static hold on the final station / punchline → (no motion; sustained held frame, no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: The pan IS the camera. One `.world` virtual-camera transform in PAN mode — `viewport-change` — sequenced across stops by `multi-phase-camera`, each stop targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (pan-to-target). No depth push-in (that distinguishes this from the cluster-push-in / dataviz-pushthrough blueprints).

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../transitions/overview.md`). One sanctioned scope extension: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg — see the Camera-Travel Carve-Out.

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the carve-out.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.
